 # Project Path_finder_Point

# This program uses pygame which is free and open-source cross-platform library 
# for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python. 
# I also implemented the queue module implements multi-producer, multi-consumer queues. 
# It is especially useful in threaded programming when information must be exchanged safely between multiple threads.

# Path finding visualizer tool is for to visualize the a star pathfinding algorithm as it runs.
